This distribution contains FUF 5.4, a system of natural language generation
based on Functional Unification Grammars.  It is dated Aug, 15 2014.

New features of version 5.4:

- Ported to "recent" CommonLisp - tested on SBCL.
  Use defpackage, def-system, quicklisp.
- New functions to facilitate testing:
  uni-fd-string: returns the unified FD and the linearized string as 2 values.
  test3: test a pair (fd, expected-string) defined by def-test and
         store the resulting unified fd for further inspection.
  get-test-result: retrieve the result unified FD of a test executed using test3.
  draw-test: run a test defined by def-test using test3 and display the
         structure of the unified FD as a tree of constituents using patterns.


- The manual has not been updated.  It is still at level 5.2.
