			  NEW FEATURES IN FUF 5.3
                                -------

This distribution contains FUF 5.3, a system of natural language generation
based on Functional Unification Grammars.  It is dated Jul 2, 1996.

New features of version 5.3:

- Added support for HTML in linearizer.  Usage is shown by example in file
  examples/html.l.
- Major bug fixes in graph traversal, loop avoiding, relocate.
- There are now 2 versions of relocate and insert-fd - one fast and buggy
  that does not work on complicated FDs and one (almost) correct and slow.
  Most of the time the fast one is good enough.  It is found in
  fd-to-graph2.l.  If you worry about correctness (:) load fd-to-graph.l.
  Examples of usage and limitations are in the source files and in
  file relocate.l.
- Added copypath construct:
  ;; Use as (att #{path})
  ;; Semantics: copy sub-fd pointed to by path at level att.
  ;; This is not a conflation - only what's currently at path
  ;; will get copied - and there won't be equality afterwards.
  Only available if load file copypath.
- Fixed punctuation and morphology bugs.
- Added ^~ notation within paths to navigate within lists encoded as FDs
  (goes up to the beginning of a list regardless of depth)
- Added flag *conflate-leaves* to control whether unification should
  conflate leaves unified or leave them as 2 distinct copies.
- Changed wait/freeze strategy as illustrated in file test-wait.l.

- The manual has not been updated.  It is still at level 5.2.
