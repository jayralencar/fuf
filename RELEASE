This distribution contains FUF 5.4, a system of natural language generation
based on the formalism of Functional Unification Grammars.
It is dated August 15, 2014.

This is the first update since 1996.
It has been ported to "more recent CommonLisp": defsystem, defpackage.
FUF and SURGE have been unified in a single package.

The latest version in general will be found on <http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/surge>

Let me know what you do with FUF!
