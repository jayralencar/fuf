;;; Modified:      5 Jul 1995 SURGE 2.2 VERSION
;;;                  - Add generic-mood to deal with same-mood constraint
;;;                    in clause conjunction
;;;                  - Allow innermost-role to be none (no partic).

;;;                  - Add possessive-relative "The man whose car I wash"
;;;                5 Nov 1995 - Fix rule of which/that/who for relative-marker
;;;               12 May 1995 - Fix alt infinitive for bare-infinitive...
;;;                             Fix alt subject-mood for bare-infinitive...
;;;               19 Aug 1996 - Remove (dative-move no) to (mood relative)
;;;                             to allow relative clauses of lexical
