FIXING GR10 
-----------

The following tests are incorrect: (T15-BIS)

1. Problem is that modality is not merged with tense
   Tense sets the "simple" attribute to indicate presence of aux
   But modal feels later aux slot.
   Modal should have its own slot in the verb sequence:
   	 must do
	 must be doing
	 must have been doing
	 must have done

	 can be doing
	 can have done	 
	 can have been done
	 
	 but not with future: (will competes on modal slot)
	 He will go
	 * He must will go

	 check with insistence

   Need to analyze all verb sequence (negation / question fronting) accordingly

2. Merge new tests of gr9 in gr10 (coverage of adjuncts / questions / relatives)

3. Check coverage of new features in gr10:

   Nominalized-ing: 
     (define-feature-type simple-clause (nominalized-ing verbal-clause))
     (define-feature-type simple-np (pronp common proper nominalized-ing))
 
  Intensifier:
     (define-feature-type adv (intensifier detensifier))

  ;; cardinal:             an fd with ((value n) (digit yes/no))
  ;; ordinal:              digit default is yes.
  ;;                       distinguishes bet. "1st" and "first".

  adv is not ignored
 
  dative-move

  lexical-roles

  circum vs. adjuncts

  verbal-clause
