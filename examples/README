This directory contains examples of grammars written in FUF, with example
inputs for each grammar.  The examples are named with numbers, indicating
increasing complexity (gr0 is very simple, gr1 a little more complex, up to
gr10 which is close in complexity to the full SURGE grammar).  
For each grammar GRi, there is a file of test input specification IRi.

In addition, file html.l contains examples of usage for the HTML attribute,
used to generate HTML code.  

Inspection of this directory is the best way to learn how to use FUF
(consider this a tutorial).
