This is the Common Lisp source for the FUF interpreter.

File graph3.l contains slight modifications to the main engine of the
unifier to allow non-monotonic manipulations of FDs written by Charles
Brendan (theorist@cs.utexas.edu).  These are not documented and include the
special keywords "remove", "end-of-list" and the constructs ^n ^n+1 and
^n-1 to add elements to lists encoded as FDs.

File linearize2.l includes extensions to the linearizer to allow generation
of HTML code.  Examples of usage are provided in file examples/html.l -
usage is not explicitly documented otherwise.

File linearize3.l includes extensions to the linearizer to support binding
theory written by Yael Netzer (yaeln@cs.bgu.ac.il).

2011 Update:

The source code has been updated to run under SBCL and adapted to "modern" (aka 2011) 
Common Lisp. Added defpackage and defsystem definitions.
