This repository contains FUF 5.4, a system of natural language generation
based on the formalism of Functional Unification Grammars.  

SURGE is a large grammar of English written in FUF used for surface realization in natural language generation.
It maps "deep syntax / lexicalized semantic" input specifications to fluent English sentences.

SURGE is written in FUF.
FUF is an interpreter written in CommonLisp.

The package includes a Dockerfile to build a container that includes a Jupyter notebook to interact with SURGE.
See [Installation Instructions](install-fuf.md).
